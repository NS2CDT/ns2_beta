            - Anything short of a full-charge shot no longer penetrates targets.
            - Shots with 75% power and above now convert to "heavy" damage type (double damage to armor), 74% power and below charge                   shots are regular damage.
            - Distortion tracer effect and steam effects no longer play if the shot didn't deal heavy damage (75% charge).

    - Gorge
        - Heal spray
            - Now adds maturity to alien structures and speeds up player evolution.
        - Hydra
            - Hydras are now extremely accurate. Accuracy tapers off starting at 8 meters up to the maximum degredation                               at 12 meters. Inaccuracy ramps between 0 and 8 degrees.
            - Hydras can now shoot back from the last spot they were hit, so if you can hit them, they can hit you.

    - Regeneration
        - Now uses EHP (effective HP) calculations (armor counts as 2 hp) when healing (so armor takes 2x as long to heal).
