- Marine
    - Shotgun
        - Reverted fire rate change.
        - Base damage now 140.
        - Introduced a damage falloff that ramps up to 20% over 4m after 8m.
        - Changed shotgun pellet size back to 16mm (from 45mm for inner pellets and 65mm for outer pellets)
        - Pellet damage is uniform for all pellets.

            - Heavy damage kicks in at 75% charge now, instead of 100% charge.
            - Full charge time is 1s (down from 1.5s)

    - Gorge
        - Hydra
            - Added a spread (inaccuracy) to the hydra's shots starting at 8 meters, and ramping up to maximum iniaccuracy at 12 meters.  Inaccuracy ramps between 0 and 8 degrees.

            - Webs now break on contact.
            - Webs now decloak from further away (5m instead of 2.5m)

    - HMG
        - Reload time: 5 -> 3.5 seconds.
    - Mines

        - Lerk spikes deal 2x damage to mines (Damage: 5 -> 10).
    - Hand Grenades
        - Deploy animation can be skipped so grenades can be switched to and thrown much faster.
    - Exosuit
        - Reduced opacity of "scanlines" texture to about 25% of original value.
        - Exosuits now "self-repair" when out of combat at a rate of 10 armor/second.

            - Anything short of a full-charge shot no longer penetrates targets.
            - Full-charge shots are "heavy" damage type (double damage to armor), non-full-charge shots are regular damage.
            - Damage ramps up from 15 to 50 as you charge.
        - Minigun

            - Damage: 10 -> 6
            - Overheat animation sped up such that the time out of combat now matches up exactly with the heat meter for that weapon (before, the overheat animation would finish well-after the heat meter was empty).

            - Hydras are now just about 100% accurate.
            - Hydras can now shoot back from the last spot they were hit, so if you can hit them, they can hit you.
            - Damage: 15 -> 10
        - Web
            - Webs now cloak, and are impossible to spot unless you get close

            - Slow duration: 1.5s -> 2.5s
            - Webs no longer appear in the kill-feed.

        - Skulks health % recovered: 20% -> 14%

        - Crag, Shade, and Shift supply cost: 25 -> 20.
